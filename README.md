# EXT2


## Project Summery: 
This project works on designing and implementing a Linux second extended file system (EXT2). To
complete this project, we read chapter 11 of our textbook written by K.C. Wang. The project consists of
three levels, each level does a different part of the file system. The first level works on the basic file
system tree and consists of the following commands: make directory, create regular file, list directory,
change directory, get current working directory path, remove directory, hard link, unlink, symbolic link,
statistics of a given directory or file, change mode, and change time. The next level, level 2, consist of
reading and writing file content. The commands of this level include open, close, read, write,
concatenation, copy, lseek, and move. The last level is level 3 which deals with mounting and unmounting
file systems along with protecting files. The commands of this level are mount, unmount, cross mounting
points, and file permission checking. Thereby making a functioning EXT2 file system.
